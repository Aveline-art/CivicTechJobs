# CivicTechJobs

CivicTechJobs is a project of Hack for LA. CivicTechJobs helps technology practitioners interested in having civic impact to find job opportunities from a central hub of listings. The website's main features include a linklist to public interest job boards and other resources relevent to their focused journey to work on projects and solve problems with a public benefit.



### Project context

Civic Tech technology practitioners are a diverse and interdisciplinary group of people. Their backgrounds are in technology, design and product.  They work inside governments, at nongovernmental agencies, and within for-profit corporations. Some of them do this full time as a career.  Some do this to develop their personal skills in collaboration. Others do this in their spare time, as a hobby.

### Technology used

- Each platform or framework should get its own bullet.
- Each platform should include an [active link](#) to the official documentation.



# How to contribute

Explain the different ways people can contribute. For example:

- Join the team {on Slack/at our weekly hack night/etc}.
- To help with user research, {do ABC}.
- To provide design support, {do XYZ}.
- To contribute to the code, follow the instructions below.

Remember to provide direct links to each channel.



## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.


### Working with issues
