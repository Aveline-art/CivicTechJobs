## Contributing to our project (for freelancers)

### Making Issues

We do not currently have a dedicated issue template for creating issues outside of our team. For now, please [open a blank issue](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues/new) and describe your inquiry as best as you can.

### Resolving Issue

1. Find a developer issue to work on from our [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/projects/1#column-10928271). (Hint: look for the 'frontend' or 'backend' label)
2. [From your local repo, create a branch off of main.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
3. Make changes to the project on that branch based on your issue.
4. [Create a pull request through the forked repo on your Github Account](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Be sure to follow the instructions on the pull request template.
5. Done! Now just wait for a team member to get back to you with feedback on your changes!

> Important note: **We do not want to be flooded with pull requests** Please, do **NOT** take on another issue or open a second pull request until the pull request and linked issue are resolved by a team member.
